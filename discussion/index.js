/* functions
	 Functions in JS are lines/blocks of codes that tell our device/application to perform
	 a certain task when called/invoked
	 
	 Functions are reusable pieces of code with instructions which are used over
	 and over again just so long as we can call/invoke them

	 Syntax: 
	 	Function functionName(){
			code block, the block of code will be executed once the function has been
			called/invoked
	 	}
